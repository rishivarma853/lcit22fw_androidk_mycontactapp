You have a table in main view showing the contacts. You have an add button to add a new contact, a search bar to search for a contact and when you swipe a cell you have an option to edit or delete the contact. Finally, when you tap on a contact you can see the contact information and you can update the information.
You should use core data to store and retrieve data.
